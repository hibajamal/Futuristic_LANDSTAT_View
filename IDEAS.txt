from img style transfer:
	- we wanna do rate of change transfer:::: we use the cnn structure to capture diff levels of image representations... ok but iska kaam hai?

	- fuck this we aint combining we are transforming.
face progression gan pyramid;
	- in the pyramid of age specific features, we can perhaps make it area specific (because that means k it is rate of change specific)
