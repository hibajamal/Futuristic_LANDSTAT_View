# LANDSTAT data future predictions
Deep Learning Model with joined Computer Vision algorithms deployed for layer enhancement and image preprocessing.

Using the glorious Google Earth Engine API to access satellite images, we save these GeoTIFFS in order to predict what a certain piece of land will look like in a 10 years. The output will be an image showing the model's prediction.

The dataset and trained model can be found [here](shorturl.at/wyzT1).
Once you access the folder:
  - The generator model is found in the models/ folder
  - Dataset is in three folders, three images are available for each place, for 2000, 2010, and 2020.
