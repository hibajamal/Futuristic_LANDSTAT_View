# LANDSTAT_FuturePredictions
Deep Learning Model with joined Computer Vision algorithms deployed for layer enhancement and image preprocessing.

Using the glorious Google Earth Engine API to access satellite images, we save these GeoTIFFS in order to predict what a certain piece of land will look like in a certain specified 'x' number of years. The output will be an image showing the model's prediction.
